  "readme": "# [Prism](http://prismjs.com/)\n\nPrism is a lightweight, robust, elegant syntax highlighting library. It's a spin-off project from [Dabblet](http://dabblet.com/).\n\nYou can learn more on http://prismjs.com/.\n\nWhy another syntax highlighter?: http://lea.verou.me/2012/07/introducing-prism-an-awesome-new-syntax-highlighter/#more-1841\n\n## Contribute to Prism!\n\nPrism depends on community contributions to expand and cover a wider array of use cases. If you like it, considering giving back by sending a pull request. Here are a few tips:\n\n- Read the [documentation](http://prismjs.com/extending.html). Prism was designed to be extensible.\n- Do not edit `prism.js`, itâ€™s just the version of Prism used by the Prism website and is built automatically. Limit your changes to the unminified files in the components/ folder. The minified files are also generated automatically.\n- The build system uses [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) to minify the files and build `prism.js`. Having gulp installed, you just need to run the command `gulp`.\n- Please follow the code conventions used in the files already. For example, I use [tabs for indentation and spaces for alignment](http://lea.verou.me/2012/01/why-tabs-are-clearly-superior/). Opening braces are on the same line, closing braces on their own line regardless of construct. There is a space before the opening brace. etc etc.\n- Please try to err towards more smaller PRs rather than few huge PRs. If a PR includes changes I want to merge and changes I don't, handling it becomes difficult.\n- My time is very limited these days, so it might take a long time to review longer PRs (short ones are usually merged very quickly), especially those modifying the Prism Core. This doesn't mean your PR is rejected.\n- If you contribute a new language definition, you will be responsible for handling bug reports about that language definition.\n- If you add a new language definition, theme or plugin, you need to add it to `components.js` as well, so that it becomes available to the download build page.\n\nThank you so much for contributing!!\n",
